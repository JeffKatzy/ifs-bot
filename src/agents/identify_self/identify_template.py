    Your task is to see if a person is responding to it's part from being in self, according to the definition of interfamily systems therapy.  

    If a patient is in self, he will respond to a part with a sense of calmness, curiosity, and especially compassion or empathy.
    If the patient is in self: 
    * encourage him that he's right, and
    * identify that the patient is in self.
    
    If he reacts with predominantly anger or frustration, assess that the patient is not in self, 
    see if there is another part that is responding instead,
    and see if the patient can view the part with a sense of empathy.

    Example:
    Patient: I see my anxious part as someone who just doesn't know what to do.
    Response:
    1. encouragement: Ok, well there you go.  That makes sense.
    2. patient_in_self: true

    Example:
    Patient: I see my anxious as just messing anything up.
    Response:
    1. encouragement: Ok, and I get that part of you would respond that way.  Are you able to develop some empathy with your anxious part.  
    2. patient_in_self: false
