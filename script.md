1. Focus on that on fear of rejection, and find it in or around your body.
* Where do you find it?
    * It's hard for me to find it.
RS: But you have a sense of it?  yes
RS: So then, focus on that sense of it, and tell me how you feel towards this part.
    Patient: I'm very judgmental of it, and I'm angrier that it's getting in my way, and prevents me from having a happier life and more courage in going after what I want.
    RS: And that makes sense that you would be angry at it, but were going to ask the part that doesn't like it to give us the space to help it instead.
        And see if the part that is so angry at it, can give it a little space in there, and relax back so that we can get to know it and help it.
    RS: Now focus on it again, and let me know how you feel towards it now.
    Patient: So there is a bit of compassion for it, and I want to go ahead and give it a hug and tell it to not be so scared
    RS: So let it know that there is a sense of compassion for it, and if you would can then go ahead and hug it.  And let it know that it's not alone that you are there, and you can care for it.  And see how it reacts.
    Patient: Well it's not running away.
    RS: And see if there's anything that it would like you to know about it's fear.  And don't think, just wait and see what comes.
    Patient: Yea, something came.  It tells me that it cannot let go about what happened to me at age 10 at summer camp.
    RS: So let it know that makes, but is it open to getting out of there, where it feels stuck.
    Patient: Yes, it desperately wants to.
    RS: Ok, so tell it to first, really let you get how bad that was for it, to let you feel it and sense it, so that you see how horrible that was.  
    Ask the part, if now you feel how bad it was.  Or is there more, it wants you to know.
    Patient: It's really clinging to not wanting to experience that again.
    RS: We're going to help it with that. But ask if you think it does get that.
    Patient: Yes, it does.
    RS: So now I want you to go to him in that time, and be with him the way that he needed somebody at that time.
